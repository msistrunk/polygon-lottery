This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Deploying Contract on local node
First, yarn install (you might need to update your node version)
```bash
yarn install
```

start a local node
```bash
npx hardhat node
```
This will provide you with a list of private keys you can use to test.
The first address provided will be the contract owner.

Deploy contract with the deploy-lottery script
```bash
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy-lottery.js
```

You can now run the site locally and interact with the contract through the UI.

## Running Locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
